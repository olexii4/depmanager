I need a CLI tool that will help me with my projects.
The CLI will have the following features:
- Support multiple package managers: npm, yarn1, yarn 2+
- Has a package manager discovery feature (npm/yarn1/yarn2+)
- Check npm dependencies for the current project
- Check for current dependencies
- If not, update dependencies
- If yes, print a message to the console
- Check dependencies for CVE
- If CVE is present, print a message to the console
